		RESULTS
			{	default = It appears even this brick can fly in this locale
			
				KerbinFlyingLowGrasslands = Yup.  Greenness affects flight in no way.
				KerbinFlyingLowHighlands = Sure.  Hghlands are higher.  Gotta stay high to keep flying.
				KerbinFlyingLowMountains = Okay.  Mountains won't make for planes to bounce off.
				KerbinFlyingLowDeserts = Right.  Just like greenness, yellowness not an issue.
				KerbinFlyingLowBadlands = Fine.  Bad, bad lands don't affect flight.
				KerbinFlyingLowTundra = Done.  Cold here, cold there.  But we are flying.
				KerbinFlyingLowIceCaps = Affirmative.  Flying over whitness is the same as everywhere else. 
				KerbinFlyingLowShores = Positive.  No problems transitioning from dry to wet.
				KerbinFlyingLowWater = Yes.  If we stop this flying, we will splash, but still crash.
				KerbinFlyingHigh = Cool.  The wind is definitly dropping off.
				
				DunaFlyingLow = Nope.  Not sure how we are staying in the air.
				DunaFlyingHigh = Argh!  You promised aerodynamic flight!
				
				LaytheFlyingLow = Agreed.  Avionics working well.
				LaytheFlyingHigh = Rad.  What a view.
				
				JoolFlyingLow = No No No.  I won't see another sunrise.
				JoolFlyingHigh = Maybe.  This doesn't seem so bad.  Very green though.
